Basically, this is a small simulation of an sand falling like game
<br />
The "slika.bmp" file in Debug is an initialization image that can be drawn or scaled (bigger resolutions hinder performance)
<br />
Before starting the simulation you can draw on the "slika.bmp" file using next rgb color scheme:
<br />
# Barrier - 0, 0, 0
<br />
+ Wood - 139,69,19
<br />
@@Water - 0, 0, 255@@
<br />
! Sand - 255,140,0
<br />
Air - 255, 255, 255
<br />
- Fire - 255,69,0 (at the moment doesnt last for more than a frame)
```
