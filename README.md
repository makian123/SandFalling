Basically, this is a small simulation of an sand falling like game
The "slika.bmp" file in Debug is an initialization image that can be drawn or scaled (bigger resolutions hinder performance)
Before starting the simulation you can draw on the "slika.bmp" file using next rgb color scheme:
Barrier - 0, 0, 0
Wood - 139,69,19
Water - 0, 0, 255
Sand - 255,140,0
Air - 255, 255, 255
Fire - 255,69,0 (at the moment doesnt last for more than a frame)
